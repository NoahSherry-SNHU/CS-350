# CS-350


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This repo has 2 projects: the first project from this course where I simply made LEDs fade on and off, and the final project where I created a mock temperature thermostat control board.

What did you do particularly well?
- I believe that in these projects I was particularly good at synthesizing the existing code and adapting to the new development environment. This was my first time using the Code Composer Studio and writing code for an embedded board, so I expected a steep learning curve.

Where could you improve?
- I could definitely improve by reading the material more carefully and understanding what architectures I'm developing for.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
-I'm adding my knowledge of embedded C programming to my network of resources for future jobs.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
-I'm really excited to apply my knowledge of state machines/management to my current job for our customer projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I'm keeping this project maintainable by  uploading both projects directly from the CCS source folder and keeping them separated by folders. Anyone can download and import these projects into CCS and run them.
